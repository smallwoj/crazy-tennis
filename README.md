# Crazy Tennis

Crazy Tennis starts off as a completely normal, non-crazy sports game, but soon shows itself to be a bullet hell combat game as you fight your way through a cast of wacky opponents up to world champion Crazy Dennis.  

The game is still in development! It's nearly complete, but there are some features in progress that aren't present in the main branch. Of course, feel free to browse around the code!
