  Tips:
  - Real-life spiders are, in general, not strong enough to hold their own tennis
    rackets. If you wish to play tennis with a real spider, consider having another
    animal volunteer to hold its racket.
  - In case you haven't noticed, the spiky purple balls can't be hit back.
  - Your racket has a surprisingly wide area of effect! It's possible to hit a ball
    withough putting yourself in the path of the balls in front of it.
