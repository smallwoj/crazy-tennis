  Tips:
  - Huma N. is a completely normal human. He enjoys long walks on the beach, bone
    harvesting, and bullying people on youtube.com.
  - Sure is nice to see another human in Crazy Tennis!
  - When the UFOs are buzzing around, they'll move to at most 4 spots before shooting
    a ball.
  - Huma N. is an incredibly vicious, efficient opponent who doesn't worry about
    extraneous things like 'fair play' or 'breathing'.
  - 'Strategy for their final attack: Stand still on the edge of the court, wait
    for the UFOs to both shoot several hittable balls in a row, and then cross the
    line of fire while swinging your racket!'
  - Huma N. used to enjoy vlogging, until he received a mean comment from Cocky Bastard.
