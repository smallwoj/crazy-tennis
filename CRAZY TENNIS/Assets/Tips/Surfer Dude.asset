  Tips:
  - Having trouble hitting Surfer Dude? Ride that wave and stand as close to the
    net as you can!
  - Surfer Dude carries a glossary of surfing terms with him at all times, printed
    on waterproof paper.
  - 'When addressing Surfer Dude, say "dude" slowly, but not too slowly. Like this:
    "duuude!"'
